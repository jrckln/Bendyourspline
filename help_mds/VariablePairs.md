It is available in various formats and contains 1000 observations of 35 variables. 

This dataset contains a random sample from Phases I & II of SUPPORT (Study to Understand Prognoses Preferences Outcomes and Risks of Treatment). For more information see <a href='https://biostat.app.vumc.org/wiki/Main/SupportDesc'> here </a>. <br>
