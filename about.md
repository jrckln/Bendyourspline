## Details
The aim of this project is to show how nonlinear associations can be estimated with a statistical model using only simple extensions of the basic linear model. The shiny app allows for comparisons between fractional polynomials, b-splines and natural splines. 

### Persons responsible for this project
Christine Wallisch, Daniela Dunkler, Georg Heinze (all from [Section for Clinical Biometrics, Center for Medical Statistics, Informatics and Intelligent Systems, Medical University of Vienna](cemsiis.meduniwien.ac.at/en/kb)) for [TG2 of the STRATOS initative](https://www.stratos-tg2.org/)

### Technical responsibility for the shinyapp

## Code
The shinyapp is implemented in the R Shiny web application framework and is deployed through RStudioâ€™s webservice [shinyapps.io](shinyapps.io). For information on used R packages and javascript libraries see the accompanying [Github](https://github.com/ljiricka/Bendyourspline) repository.
