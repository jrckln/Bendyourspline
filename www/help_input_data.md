Select "no data" to explore the methods data-independently OR
specify a variable pair, which relation you would like to investigate.


You can choose between 4 real-life data sets. For detailed information on these data sets switch to the ABOUT tab. 

### Advanced settings

Here you can select a subset of the original data set, which is then shown in the plot of the response function panel. This helps you to explore differences in functional forms between sample sizes or between men and women. 

First, you can select between data of women (female), men (male) or both. 

Second, you can choose the percentage of the original data set, which should be drawn. 

Third, by passing a number to seed, you initialize the random number generator and a random subset is drawn with the size, which is the selected percentage * size of the original data set. If you set one specific seed value, the same subset is always used. If you like to draw a different subset, choose another seed number.
