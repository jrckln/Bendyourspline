Here information about the goodness of your current fit (response) is printed.

### adjusted R<sup>2</sup> 

The adjusted R<sup>2</sup> is the proportion of variation in the dependent variable explained by the independent variable adjusted for the number of covariates in the model (i.e. the number of coefficients).

The adjusted RÂ² penalizes model fit by model complexity. The maximum value is 1 but it can also take negative values if coefficients or the intercept are chosen badly.

### maximal adjusted R<sup>2</sup> 

This number gives the maximal adjusted R<sup>2</sup> based on the optimal fit, which can be reached with the chosen variable pair.
