## Goodness of fit 

Here information about the goodness of your current fit (response) is printed.

### adjusted R<sup>2</sup> 

The adjusted R<sup>2</sup> is the proportion of variation in the dependent variable explained by the independent variable adjusted for the number of covariates in the model (i.e. the number of coefficients).

### maximal adjusted R<sup>2</sup> 

This number gives the maximal adjusted R<sup>2</sup> that can be reached with the chosen variable pair and 

* the powers for fractional polynomials 
* the degree and number of knots for B-splines
* the number of knots for natural splines
