TODO: 
x   in tab methods: input variable to select refers to name of list of data (data_list): show different names
x   in file data.R -> sample.sizes "all" is restricted to data_list$bmi_age
x   reset button on tab "fp" not working correctly - one has to press multiple times in order to reset everything?
